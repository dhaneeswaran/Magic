# 21-Card-Trick
A simple card trick in Python. Be amazed.

You will be shown three rows of 13 playing cards (abbreviated, ie KC for King of Clubs, 4S for 4 of Spades, and so on). Pick any card and input the row that your card is in. This repeats 3 times, asking each time for the row that your original card appears in.

After the third time, the computer will identify the card that you were thinking of.
