# The 21 Card Trick
A simple card trick in Python. Be amazed.

You will be shown three rows of 7 playing cards.
Pick any card and input the row that your card is in.
This repeats 3 times, asking each time for the row that your original card appears in.

After the third time, the computer will identify the card that you were thinking of.
